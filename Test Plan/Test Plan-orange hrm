Attendance Management: Clock-in, clock-out, and attendance history tracking.
Payroll Management: Employee salary processing, deductions, and payslips generation.
Performance Management: Appraisal process, performance reviews, and feedback mechanisms.
Recruitment: Job posting, application submission, candidate screening, and recruitment reporting.
Security & Compliance: Authentication, authorization, data encryption, and audit logging.
Usability: Ensuring the application is intuitive, user-friendly, and performs as expected.
Inclusions:

Test case creation and execution

Password encryption and two-factor authentication (2FA)
Access Permissions:

Testers, developers, admins, and HR personnel will have appropriate access roles for testing.
5. Defect Reporting Procedure
Defect Identification: Any issue that deviates from the requirements or causes functional failure will be logged.
Defect Reporting:
Defects should be reported using JIRA (or a similar tool) with the following details:
Defect ID
Steps to reproduce
Expected vs. actual results
Severity and priority level
Screenshots or logs
Triaging and Prioritization:
Defects will be classified by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and priority (P1, P2, P3).
Affected modules will be identified for quicker resolution.
Defect Resolution: Developers will address defects based on priority and severity.
Tracking: Defects will be tracked in JIRA for continuous monitoring.
Metrics: Time taken to fix defects, number of defects fixed, and defect severity.
6. Test Strategy
Objectives: The overall goal of testing is to verify all critical functionalities of OrangeHRM including employee management, leave/attendance tracking, payroll processing, and security protocols.

Test Levels:

Unit Testing: Testing individual modules like leave management, payroll, and attendance.
Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between different modules such as leave and payroll.
System Testing: Full application testing in an environment similar to production.
Acceptance Testing: Testing with actual users to ensure the HRM system meets business requirements.
Test Types:

Functional Testing: Testing all core features (leave, payroll, attendance, etc.)
Non-Functional Testing: Includes performance, security, and usability testing.
Regression Testing: Ensuring that recent changes do not affect existing functionality.
Test Techniques:

Black-box Testing: Focused on testing the functionality without knowledge of internal code.
White-box Testing: Focused on internal logic and code, especially for security testing.
Exploratory Testing: Ad-hoc testing to explore new functionalities or areas not covered by pre-defined test cases.
Test Deliverables:
